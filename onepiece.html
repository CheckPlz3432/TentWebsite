        <h4>(Literally means: Ambition)</h4>
        <p>Haki is an energy based power system in the anime/manga series "One Piece". Haki is a mysterious power
          that allows the user to utilize their own spiritual energy for various purposes. It can be used to sense
          people's spiritual energy and predict their actions, give the user a protective coating of spiritual
          energy, and, for a certain group of "chosen ones", overpower the willpower of others. All living beings
          in the world are capable of learning Haki; however, most people do not notice it or fail to awaken it.
        </p>
        <h2>There are 3 types of Haki: Armament, Observation, and Conqueror</h2>
        <h4>*How Haki sounds:</h4>

      <h2 class="hakitypetitle">What is Armament Haki (Busoshoku no Haki)?</h2>
      <img src="https://c.tenor.com/1tD_SPMrJuwAAAAC/one-piece-luffy.gif" alt="Luffy's Armament Haki">
      <h4>(Literally means: Armament-type Haki)</h4>
      <p>Armament Haki is a form of Haki that allows the user to use their own spiritual energy to create, in
        essence, an invisible armor around themself, providing incredible offensive and defensive
        capabilities.</p>
      <h2>Have I ever used Armament Haki?</h2>
      <p>I haven't really used this form of Haki very often, as I don't rely on brute strength in
        competitions, however, I used Armament Haki on once to create a sort of defense against ball being
        kicked at me during my soccer championship in gym class some weeks ago.</p>
      <h2>What is Observation Haki (Kenbunshoku no Haki)?</h2>
      <img src="https://c.tenor.com/ximNM3uVdqQAAAAC/luffy-one-piece-haki.gif" alt="Luffy's Observation Haki">
      <h4>(Literally means: Observation-type Haki)</h4>
      <p>Observation Haki is a form of Haki that grants the user a sixth sense that allows them to sense the
        presence, strength, and emotions of others, as well as gain limited precognitive abilities.</p>
      <h2>Have I ever used Observation Haki?</h2>
      <p>I often use this to hear conversations, see the bus coming for school, and to have a greater sense of
        "feeling". I imagine a sphere around my body. This is often useful in playing dodgeball to
        instanteneously dodge balls thrown at me.</p>

      <h2>What is Conqueror's Haki (Haoshoku no Haki)?</h2>
      <img src="https://c.tenor.com/riLz0MftNXsAAAAC/luffy-conqueror-haki.gif" alt="Luffy's Conqueror's Haki">
      <h4>(Literally means: Supreme Ruler-type Haki)</h4>
      <p>Conqueror's Haki is a rare form of Haki that allows the user to exert their own willpower over
        others. This type of Haki cannot be attained through training and only one in several million people
        are born with this ability. It is said that whoever possesses this type of Haki has the qualities of a
        king.</p>
      <h2>Have I ever used Conqueror's Haki?</h2>
      <p>During a big capture the flag game at camp this year, I used a powerful gaze to frighten the enemy
        team (at the border) from coming to our side of the field and stealing our flags.</p>
