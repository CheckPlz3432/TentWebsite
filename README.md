Hi, my name is Trenton. This is my website.
Link: https://checkplz3432.github.io/TentWebsite/

I'm using
- HTML
- CSS
  - Bootstrap
- JS
  - React (coming soon)

Next Step:
Finalize getting rid of tailwind.css and fixing the layout of the blog page,
using an extra page as a template

Add react.js to project at some point

Make the responsive js space stars background from: https://www.sliderrevolution.com/resources/css-animated-background/ and https://codepen.io/riley-pearce/pen/OJWPjZM
