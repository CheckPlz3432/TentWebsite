        <h4>(Haki literally means: Ambition)</h4>
        <h4>“Haki' is a power that lies dormant in all the world's creatures.
         'Presence', 'fighting spirit' and 'intimidation.' 
        It is not different from the things that humans can naturally sense such as these. 
        'The act of not doubting'. That is strength!”</h4>
        <p>Haki is an energy based power system in the anime/manga series "One Piece". Haki is a mysterious power
          that allows the user to utilize their own spiritual energy for various purposes. It can be used to sense
          people's spiritual energy, grant the user armour-like skin, and intimidate others. All living beings
          in the world are capable of learning Haki; however, most people do not notice it or fail to awaken it.
        </p>
        <h2>There are 3 types of Haki: Armament, Observation, and Conqueror's</h2>
        <h4>*How Haki sounds:</h4>

      <p class="onepiecetext">Armament Haki is a form of Haki that allows the user to use their own spiritual energy to create, in
        essence, an invisible armor around themself, providing incredible offensive and defensive
        capabilities.</p>
      <h2 class="onepiecetext">Have I ever used Armament Haki?</h2>
      <p class="onepiecetext">When practicing Taekwondo, I use Armament Haki to buff up my body

      <p class="onepiecetext">Observation Haki is a form of Haki that grants the user a sixth sense that allows them to sense the
        presence, strength, and emotions of others, and can even let the user see into the future.</p>
      <h2 class="onepiecetext">Have I ever used Observation Haki?</h2>
      <p class="onepiecetext">I often use this in dodgeball games to instanteneously dodge balls thrown at me given enough distance.
        I'm able to tell when I will be faked out with a ball vs actually being attacked.</p>

      <p class="onepiecetext">Conqueror's Haki is a rare form of Haki that allows the user to exert their own willpower over
        others. This type of Haki cannot be attained through training and only one in several million people
        are born with this ability. It is said that whoever possesses this type of Haki has the qualities of a
        king.</p>
      <h2 class="onepiecetext">Have I ever used Conqueror's Haki?</h2>
      <p class="onepiecetext">My enthusiasm in playing Capture the Flag often awakens my Conqueror's! 
        I often glare menacingly at my opponents and scare them from coming to my side
        of the field to steal my flags.</p>
