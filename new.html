        <h5>April 2024</h5>
        <p>You wanna be 'Red Line menaces'? - Jude G.</p>
        <p>Yo, what are your thoughts on the Brown Line? - Rohith K.</p>
        <p>As the CTA is preparing to extend the Red Line south to 130th Street in Chicago, one must wonder
          what other additions and alternation can be made to the city's transit system to make it more accessible.
          A draft made by David Sotokarlin exemplifies a new CTA train line, derived from the existing Metra Electric
          Line called
          the CTA Lime Line, providing cheap, high speed transit to the citizens of the East Side of Chicago. Learn more
          about this draft

          makes someone's willpower into greater physical, mental, and spiritual strength, and a select few with the
          strongest of wills,
          can impose themselves among thousands of people! Learn more about it here!
